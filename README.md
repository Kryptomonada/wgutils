# wgutils

This is a utility command to help with managing Working Groups. It was designed
for the GraphQL Working Groups, but could be used for other projects that work
in a similar way.

Work in progress, documentation to come.

## Current limitations

These are known limitations of the software that we won't bother to address
unless there's a need to do so:

- Primary meeting must be the first meeting in the month (otherwise 'prior
  meetings' is not populated correctly)
